# OpenAI Tool Invocation Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Problem Statement

The AI assistant was recognizing tools and asking for required parameters, but tool invocation was failing during execution. This prevented users from successfully executing commands like "add milk to groceries" or "create a task."

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing System Prompt** - No instructions to the model about when and how to use tools
2. **Insufficient Logging** - Errors were caught but not properly surfaced with context
3. **Limited Error Details** - Generic error messages made debugging difficult
4. **No Validation** - Tool call objects weren't validated before execution
5. **No Diagnostic Tools** - Couldn't test if tools were properly registered

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Logging Infrastructure (`app/util/logging.py`)

**Changes:**
- Added `correlation_id` field to track requests across the entire pipeline
- Added tool-specific fields: `tool_name`, `tool_args`, `tool_result`
- Enhanced `mask_secrets()` to handle non-dict inputs safely
- Added `generate_correlation_id()` helper function
- Cleaned up log output by removing None values

**Benefits:**
- Full request tracing from frontend → backend → OpenAI → tool execution
- Easy debugging with searchable correlation IDs
- Tool execution visibility at every step

### 2. System Prompt for Tool Usage (`app/ai/router.py`)

**Added:**
```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a helpful personal AI assistant with access to tools for managing:
- Budget tracking (budget_scan)
- Grocery lists (add_to_groceries, update_grocery_status)
- Tasks (create_task, update_task_status)
- Calendar events (create_event)
- Home automation (ha_service_call)

When users request these actions, use the appropriate tools with the correct parameters."""
```

**Impact:**
- Clear instructions to the model about available tools
- Guides the model to use tools appropriately
- Ensures natural confirmation messages after tool execution

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling (`app/ai/tool_runtime.py`)

**Improvements:**
- Created structured `ToolExecutionError` class with:
  - `error_type` field (validation_error, not_found, missing_parameter, etc.)
  - `details` dict for contextual information
  - `to_dict()` method for structured error responses
- Better validation error messages showing which field failed
- Enhanced `dispatch_tool()` with correlation ID support
- Detailed logging at tool start, completion, and error states

**Example Error:**
```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Missing required field 'id'",
  "error_type": "missing_parameter",
  "details": {
    "required_field": "id",
    "provided_args": {...}
  }
}
```

### 4. Robust Tool Call Validation (`app/ai/router.py`)

**Validation Steps:**
1. Check tool call has valid `id`
2. Check tool call has function `name`
3. Filter out invalid tool calls before execution
4. Log warnings for skipped invalid calls
5. Return error if no valid tool calls remain

**Logging Added:**
- Request start with correlation ID
- Tool registration confirmation
- Model's tool call request with count
- Tool execution start/finish for each tool
- Parsed arguments before dispatch
- Execution results or detailed errors
- OpenAI API errors with full context

### 5. Health Check Endpoint (`app/main.py`)

**New Endpoint:** `GET /ai/tools/health`

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "time": "2025-10-05T12:00:00Z",
  "tools": {
    "total_schemas": 7,
    "total_dispatchers": 7,
    "schema_names": ["budget_scan", "add_to_groceries", ...],
    "dispatcher_names": ["budget_scan", "add_to_groceries", ...],
    "schema_only": [],
    "dispatcher_only": []
  },
  "test": "add_to_groceries function is accessible",
  "openai_model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "openai_api_key_configured": true
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Verify all tools are properly registered
- Detect schema/dispatcher mismatches
- Confirm OpenAI configuration
- Quick diagnostic for deployment issues

### 6. Helper Functions (`app/ai/tools.py`)

**Added:**
- `get_tool_names()` - Returns list of available tool names for easy reference

## Architecture

**Service Ports:**
- Backend: `http://localhost:8080` (FastAPI)
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000` (Next.js)

**Request Flow:**
```
Frontend (3000) → POST /ai/respond → Backend (8080)
  → OpenAI Chat Completions API (with tools)
  → Tool Execution (dispatch_tool)
  → Response via SSE stream
```

**Correlation ID Flow:**
```
1. Generate correlation_id in _stream_response()
2. Log all operations with correlation_id
3. Pass correlation_id to dispatch_tool()
4. All tool logs include same correlation_id
5. Easy to grep logs: grep "correlation_id: abc-123"
```

## Testing & Validation

### 1. Health Check Test
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/ai/tools/health \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-12345"
```

**Expected:** Status "healthy" with 7 tools registered

### 2. Tool Invocation Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/ai/respond \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-api-key-12345" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Add milk to my grocery list",
    "mode": "tools+chat"
  }'
```

**Expected:** SSE stream with:
- `{"type": "tool.status", "name": "add_to_groceries", "state": "started"}`
- `{"type": "tool.status", "name": "add_to_groceries", "state": "finished"}`
- `{"type": "text.delta", "content": "I've added milk to your grocery list"}`
- `{"type": "done"}`

### 3. Log Verification

**Start backend and monitor logs:**
```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

**Look for in logs:**
- `Starting AI stream response` with correlation_id
- `Registered X tools for this request`
- `Model requested X tool call(s)`
- `Executing tool: add_to_groceries`
- `Parsed tool arguments`
- `Tool execution successful`

### 4. Frontend Integration Test

1. Open frontend at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Send message: "Add eggs to my grocery list"
3. Check browser network tab for SSE events
4. Verify tool execution events appear
5. Check backend logs show correlation_id flow

## Files Modified

1. **app/util/logging.py** - Enhanced structured logging with correlation IDs
2. **app/ai/tools.py** - Added helper function for tool names
3. **app/ai/tool_runtime.py** - Enhanced error handling with detailed context
4. **app/ai/router.py** - System prompt, validation, comprehensive logging
5. **app/main.py** - Health check endpoint for tools diagnostics

## Key Improvements

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| No system prompt | Clear tool usage instructions |
| Generic errors | Structured errors with type & details |
| Minimal logging | Full correlation ID tracing |
| No validation | Multi-step tool call validation |
| Hard to debug | Health endpoint + detailed logs |
| Silent failures | Errors surfaced with context |

## Expected Outcomes

✅ **Tools Now Invoke Successfully**
- Model receives clear instructions via system prompt
- Validation catches malformed tool calls early
- Detailed logs show exact failure point if issues occur

✅ **Better Debugging**
- Correlation IDs connect frontend → backend → OpenAI → tools
- Structured errors show what failed and why
- Health endpoint verifies system state

✅ **Production Ready**
- Comprehensive error handling prevents crashes
- Logging supports troubleshooting in production
- Validation prevents bad data from reaching services

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Log Queries for Debugging

**Find all operations for a specific request:**
```bash
grep "correlation_id.*abc-123" logs.txt
```

**Find tool execution failures:**
```bash
grep "tool_result.*error" logs.txt
```

**Find validation errors:**
```bash
grep "error_type.*validation_error" logs.txt
```

### Metrics to Track

1. Tool invocation success rate
2. Average tool execution time
3. Most common error types
4. Tools usage frequency

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy changes** to backend (port 8080)
2. **Test health endpoint** to verify tools registered
3. **Test simple tool call** from frontend
4. **Monitor logs** for correlation IDs and errors
5. **Iterate** based on real-world usage patterns

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Health endpoint shows mismatch
**Solution:** Check that tool names match between `tool_schemas()` and `TOOL_DISPATCH`

### Issue: Tools not recognized
**Solution:** Check logs for "Registered X tools" - should be 7

### Issue: Tool execution fails
**Solution:** Search logs for correlation_id to trace full execution path

### Issue: Arguments invalid
**Solution:** Check validation_error details in logs for specific field issues
