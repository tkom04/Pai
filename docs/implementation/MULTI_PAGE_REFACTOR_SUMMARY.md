# Multi-Page Dashboard Refactor - Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully refactored the single-page dashboard with tab-based navigation into a proper multi-page Next.js application with 7 separate pages and proper routing.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Widget Components
Extracted reusable widgets from the old Dashboard component:
- **`frontend/components/widgets/UpcomingEventsWidget.tsx`** - Displays upcoming calendar events
- **`frontend/components/widgets/MiniCalendarWidget.tsx`** - Shows the current week with today's event count
- **`frontend/components/widgets/FloatingAiButton.tsx`** - Floating AI chat assistant

### 2. Created Shared Layout Component
- **`frontend/components/Layout.tsx`** - Shared layout with:
  - Collapsible sidebar navigation (desktop)
  - Bottom navigation bar (mobile)
  - Top bar with page title
  - Floating AI assistant button
  - Next.js Link components for proper routing
  - Active route highlighting

### 3. Created Page Structure

#### **`frontend/pages/index.tsx`** - Personalized Landing Page
A beautiful welcome screen featuring:
- Time-based greeting (Good morning/afternoon/evening)
- Smart event summary (shows today or tomorrow based on time)
- Quick stats cards showing:
  - Upcoming events count
  - Pending tasks count
  - Shopping items to buy
- Call-to-action button to "Go to Dashboard"
- Animated background with gradients
- Responsive design

#### **`frontend/pages/dashboard.tsx`** - Full Dashboard
- Weather widget
- Upcoming events widget
- Mini calendar widget
- 3-column responsive grid layout

#### **`frontend/pages/calendar.tsx`** - Calendar View
- Full calendar interface with Google Calendar integration

#### **`frontend/pages/tasks.tsx`** - Tasks Management
- Task list with add/edit/delete functionality
- Task filtering and sorting

#### **`frontend/pages/shopping.tsx`** - Shopping List
- Grocery list with check-off functionality
- Add/remove items

#### **`frontend/pages/budget.tsx`** - Budget Tracking
- Budget overview and transaction management

#### **`frontend/pages/settings.tsx`** - Settings Page

### 4. Cleanup
- Removed old `frontend/components/Dashboard.tsx` component
- All imports updated automatically

## Key Benefits

✅ **Proper URL Routing** - Each section has its own URL:
- `/` - Landing page
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard
- `/calendar` - Calendar view
- `/tasks` - Tasks management
- `/shopping` - Shopping list
- `/budget` - Budget tracking
- `/settings` - Settings

✅ **Browser Navigation** - Back/forward buttons work naturally

✅ **Shareable Links** - Users can bookmark and share direct links to specific sections

✅ **Better Code Organization** - Each page is self-contained and easier to maintain

✅ **Performance** - Next.js automatic code splitting means faster initial load

✅ **Mobile Responsive** - Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop
