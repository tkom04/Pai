# Timezone Fixes - "Can't Compare Offset-Naive and Offset-Aware Datetimes"

## Problem Fixed
Your application was experiencing `TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes` when creating Google Calendar events. This occurred because Python refuses to compare datetimes that have timezone information with those that don't.

## Root Causes
1. **Inconsistent datetime handling**: Some datetimes were timezone-aware (with UTC offset) while others were naive (no timezone info)
2. **Google Auth library comparison bug**: The `google-auth` library's internal comparison of `credentials.expiry` vs `utcnow()` was mixing aware and naive datetimes
3. **Missing standardization**: No single helper function to normalize all datetime inputs

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added `to_aware_utc()` Helper Function
**File**: `app/util/time.py`

Created a comprehensive helper that:
- Accepts ISO8601 strings or datetime objects
- Normalizes all inputs to timezone-aware UTC datetimes
- Handles naive datetimes by assuming Europe/London timezone (for BST/GMT handling)
- Provides consistent datetime handling across the entire application

```python
def to_aware_utc(dt_or_str: Union[str, datetime, None], default_tz: str = "Europe/London") -> Optional[datetime]:
    """
    Convert any datetime or ISO8601 string to timezone-aware UTC datetime.

    Examples:
        >>> to_aware_utc("2025-10-11T11:11:00+00:00")  # Already aware → UTC
        >>> to_aware_utc("2025-10-11T11:11:00")         # Naive → treated as Europe/London → UTC
        >>> to_aware_utc(datetime.now())                 # Naive → treated as Europe/London → UTC
    """
```

### 2. Updated Calendar Service
**File**: `app/services/calendar.py`

- Replaced `make_aware()` with `to_aware_utc()` in all methods
- Added validation to ensure event end time is after start time
- Added `now_utc` for consistent current time comparisons
- Applied fixes to:
  - `create_event()` - event creation with proper timezone handling
  - `get_events()` - query date range filtering
  - `update_event()` - event updates

### 3. Google OAuth Credentials Workaround
**File**: `app/auth/google_oauth.py`

Added critical workaround in `get_calendar_service()`:

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Workaround for google-auth comparison bug
if getattr(creds, "expiry", None) is not None:
    if creds.expiry.tzinfo is not None:
        # Make expiry naive UTC so google-auth's internal comparison succeeds
        creds.expiry = creds.expiry.astimezone(timezone.utc).replace(tzinfo=None)
```

This normalizes `credentials.expiry` to naive UTC before building the Google Calendar service, preventing the comparison error in the Google Auth library's internal checks.

### 4. Updated FastAPI Endpoints
**File**: `app/main.py`

- Changed all `now()` calls to `utc_now()` for explicit UTC timestamps
- Updated `/events` endpoint to use `to_aware_utc()` for query parameters
- Ensured all datetime handling in health checks and endpoints uses timezone-aware datetimes

### 5. Enhanced Pydantic Models
**File**: `app/models.py`

- Added timezone validator to `CreateTaskRequest.due` field
- Existing `CreateEventRequest` already had validators for `start` and `end`
- These validators ensure all incoming datetime fields are timezone-aware:

```python
@field_validator('due')
@classmethod
def ensure_timezone_aware(cls, v: datetime) -> datetime:
    """Ensure datetime is timezone-aware after Pydantic parses it."""
    if v is None:
        return v
    if isinstance(v, datetime) and v.tzinfo is None:
        return v.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)
    return v
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Comparison Errors**: All datetimes are now consistently timezone-aware UTC
2. **BST/GMT Handling**: Naive datetimes are correctly interpreted as Europe/London time
3. **Google API Compatibility**: Workaround prevents internal comparison errors in Google Auth
4. **Validation at Entry**: Pydantic validators ensure timezone-awareness from the start
5. **Consistent Time Handling**: Single source of truth with `to_aware_utc()` helper

## Testing Checklist

To verify the fix works:

```python
# Test that all datetimes are timezone-aware
from app.util.time import to_aware_utc, utc_now
from datetime import timezone

# These should all succeed without comparison errors
s = to_aware_utc("2025-10-11T11:11:00+00:00")
e = to_aware_utc("2025-10-11T22:22:00+00:00")
now = utc_now()

assert s.tzinfo is not None
assert e.tzinfo is not None
assert now.tzinfo is not None
assert s < e
assert now > s  # Assuming test runs after the date
```

## Files Changed

1. `app/util/time.py` - Added `to_aware_utc()` helper
2. `app/services/calendar.py` - Updated all datetime handling
3. `app/auth/google_oauth.py` - Added credentials.expiry workaround
4. `app/main.py` - Updated endpoints to use timezone-aware datetimes
5. `app/models.py` - Enhanced Pydantic validators for datetime fields

## Recommendation

**Upgrade Google Auth libraries** (when possible) for long-term fix:

```bash
pip install -U google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client
```

Recent versions of these libraries handle timezone comparisons more robustly. The workaround we added will continue to work even after upgrading, but newer versions may not need it.

## Next Steps

1. Test creating calendar events with various datetime formats
2. Verify that the error no longer appears in logs
3. Monitor application for any remaining timezone-related issues
4. Consider upgrading Google Auth libraries when convenient
