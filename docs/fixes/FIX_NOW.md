# üö® URGENT FIX REQUIRED

## The Problem
Your Google Calendar OAuth is failing because the `google_oauth_tokens` table has the **wrong data type** for the `user_id` column.

**Error**: `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "default-user"`
**Cause**: Table was created with `user_id UUID` but needs `user_id TEXT`

## The Solution (5 minutes)

### 1. Run This SQL in Supabase NOW ‚ö°

Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/whlsxrfxsyqnoilyauji/editor

Copy the entire contents of this file:
```
supabase_migrations/001a_fix_google_oauth_tokens.sql
```

Paste into Supabase SQL Editor and click **RUN**.

This will:
- Drop the old table (if it exists)
- Create a new table with the correct schema (`user_id TEXT`)
- Add all necessary indexes and policies

### 2. Restart Your Backend

```powershell
# Press Ctrl+C in the backend terminal
# Then run:
.\start_fixed.ps1
```

### 3. Connect Google Calendar

1. Open: http://localhost:3000/settings
2. Click **"Connect Calendar"** button
3. Authorize with Google
4. You'll be redirected back to settings
5. Should show **"‚úì Connected"**

### 4. Test It Works

Go to the Calendar page and try creating an event. It should work now!

## What Was Wrong?

### Issue 1: Wrong Data Type ‚ùå
- **Expected**: `user_id TEXT` (to store "default-user")
- **Actual**: `user_id UUID` (expecting a UUID format)
- **Result**: Database rejected "default-user" string

### Issue 2: Two Different OAuth Flows ü§î
You have TWO separate Google OAuth systems:

1. **Login Page** (`/login`)
   - Supabase OAuth
   - Logs you into the PAI app
   - Does NOT connect to Google Calendar

2. **Settings Page** (`/settings`)
   - Google Calendar OAuth
   - Gives app permission to access your calendar
   - This is what you need for calendar features

**You need BOTH**: First login, then connect calendar in settings.

## After the Fix

Once you run the SQL migration:

‚úÖ Settings page "Connect Calendar" button will work
‚úÖ OAuth flow will complete successfully
‚úÖ Calendar event creation will return 200 OK (not 500)
‚úÖ Events will appear in your Google Calendar

## Still Not Working?

See `OAUTH_FIX_COMPLETE.md` for detailed troubleshooting.

## Quick Test

After running the fix, test with:

```powershell
# Check auth status (should not have "error" field)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8080/auth/google/status" -Headers @{"X-API-Key"="dev-api-key-12345"} -UseBasicParsing
```

Should return:
```json
{"authenticated":false,"service":"Google Calendar"}
```

(The `false` is normal before you connect in Settings)
